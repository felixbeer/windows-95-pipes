# Windows 95 Pipes

An experiment to recreate the pipes screensaver from Windows 95 using Unity.

The basic logic of the pipe positioning is, that the pipes need to go at least one step in the a direction before they can change direction. Also there is a random bias of 75% to go straight and 25% to change direction in general.
